Official implementation of "Object-level Geometric Structure Preserving for Natural Image Stitching".

## Install

1. Compile ```Opencv 4.4.0```, ```VLFEAT``` and ```Eigen``` locally.

2. Create a new Visual Studio ```.sln```, and add all ```.cpp``` and ```.h``` files into this .sln.

3. Set HED file paths in ```EdgeDetection.cpp```.

## StitchBench

StitchBench is by far the most comprehensive image stitching dataset.
A sample image pair is provided in ```./input-data/AANAP-01_skyline```. 
StitchBench will be released soon.

## Segment Anything Model Script
Run ```.sln``` and you will find 0-original.png in the ```./``` folder.
Upload the image to Google Colab and run sam.ipynb to get SAM features and put it in ./ folder.

## Usage
For any questions, please feel free to open an issue.
